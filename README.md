## ✍️ Approach Based on Visualization Principles

### 1️⃣ Select Appropriate Charts for Each Data Type

- **Bar Charts**: Most profitable categories and regional performance
- **Scatter Plot**: Discount vs. Profit relationship
- **Choropleth Map** *(if geo data available)*: Sales by U.S. states

### 2️⃣ Simplify and Eliminate Clutter
- Clean layouts with minimalistic color usage
- Focused visuals (e.g., Top 5 or Top 10 items per metric)
- Consistent formatting across charts

### 3️⃣ Highlight Business-Critical Insights
- Annotated visuals to guide viewer attention
- Emphasis on trends, outliers, and patterns

### 4️⃣ Add Clear Context to All Charts
- Descriptive titles, axis labels, legends
- Visual cues for storytelling

### 5️⃣ Insights Over Aesthetics
- Visuals are designed to communicate decisions, not just decorate
- Key findings translated into potential business actions

### 6️⃣ Storyboard Summary
- All findings and charts are compiled into a storyboard slide
- Includes conclusion and data-driven recommendations
